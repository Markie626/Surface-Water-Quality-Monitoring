# Surface-Water-Quality-Monitoring
Surface water is water that is found in lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and other natural watercourses. It is also found in marine bays, estuaries, and oceans. This valuable resource provides drinking water, supplies Nova Scotian businesses with their water supply, and supports important industries such as fishing, farming and electric power generation. Surface water supports various recreational activities such as swimming and boating, and provides habitat for aquatic life.

The Nova Scotia Automated Surface Water Quality Monitoring Network was established in 2002 to assess water quality in surface waters across the province at five stations (and one discontinued station, St Mary's River). The results are used to help manage water resources, determine baseline water quality in lakes and watercourses throughout the province, evaluate the impact of human activities on surface water, and assess long term trends in water quality associated with issues such as acid rain, eutrophication, and climate change.

The data is measurements collected on an hourly timestep using water quality instruments at five stations: Pockwock Lake (NS01EH0050), Shelburne River (NS01ED9111), Northeast Margaree River (NS01FB0001), Kelley River (NS01DL0009) and LaHave River (NS01EF0002). Data for the discontinued St Mary's River (NS01EO0001) site is for the 2007 to 2008 time period. The measured water quality parameters are the following: temperature (°C), pH (-), conductivity (µS/cm), and dissolved oxygen (mg/L).

The aim of this project is to visualize these key metrics over a year spanning from 2023-11-15 to 2024-12-06.
